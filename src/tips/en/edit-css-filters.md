The [`filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/filter) property in CSS lets you change the way a particular element gets rendered.

Firefox provides a visual editor to play with CSS filters. You can add or remove filter functions from the list, re-order them, edit individual functions and even create presets that you can reuse later.

* In the Rules panel, find an existing `filter` property, or add a new one.
* Click on the filter swatch icon next to the filter value.
